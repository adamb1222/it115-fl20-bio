Adam Nicholas Bogonko
Adam Bogonko is an emerging business professional. 
Born in Indiana and moving around a lot, he spent most of my life in Oklahoma in a
fairly rural area where selling eggs was his kind of only source of income, he
saw that as an opportunity to better his consumer/supplier interaction. 
He now holds about 2 1/2 years worth of customer experience from fast food restaurants
to spray paint tattoos and know how to keep a professional yet friendly relationship with his customers. 

During high school, he was blessed with the opportunity to join “Rotary International”,
an organization specializing in not only serving your local community but also aiding third
world countries, this helped him grow both professionally and as a person as he was able to
learn leadership skills, humanitarian beliefs, and so on. 

He lives by one motto and one motto only “The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer someone else up.” -Mark Twain. 
He's noticed that whenever he's feeling down, watching someone smile or laugh, has always lightened his mood no matter 
the circumstances, and by helping others achieve a smile you are not only doing them a favor, but doing yourself a favor as well.
